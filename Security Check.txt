Based on my analysis of your Next.js + Supabase + TypeScript resume enhancement application, I'll provide a comprehensive security and code quality audit report.

Security & Code Quality Audit Report
Executive Summary
Your application demonstrates good foundational security practices with Supabase authentication and Row Level Security (RLS) policies. However, there are several areas requiring attention for enhanced security, code quality, and performance optimization.

üî¥ Critical Security Issues
1. API Route Authorization Bypass Risk
File: route.ts Severity: High Issue: The API route doesn't verify if the user owns the resume being processed

Recommendation: Add user ID verification:

2. Input Sanitization Gaps
Files: Multiple components Severity: Medium-High Issue: Limited HTML sanitization for user inputs Recommendation: Implement DOMPurify for all user-generated content:

3. File Upload Security
File: file-uploader.tsx Severity: Medium Issue: MIME type validation exists but lacks content verification Current:

Recommendation: Add magic number verification and virus scanning.

üü° Medium Priority Issues
4. Environment Variable Exposure
Files: Multiple Severity: Medium Issue: Client-side environment variables may leak sensitive data Recommendation: Audit all NEXT_PUBLIC_ variables and ensure no sensitive data exposure.

5. Edge Function Resource Limits
Files: index.ts, index.ts Severity: Medium Issue: No timeout or resource usage monitoring Recommendation: Implement proper timeout handling and resource monitoring.

6. Database Query Optimization
Files: Multiple API calls Severity: Medium Issue: Missing database indexes and query optimization Recommendation: Add indexes for frequently queried fields.

üîç Code Quality Issues
7. Type Safety Gaps
Severity: Medium Issues Found:

Inconsistent error type handling
Missing null checks in several components
any types in some API responses
Recommendations:

8. Error Handling Inconsistencies
Files: Various components Severity: Medium Issue: Inconsistent error handling patterns across components Recommendation: Implement a centralized error handling utility.

9. Dead Code Detection
Issues Found:

Unused imports in several files
Unreferenced utility functions
Duplicate interface definitions
10. Performance Concerns
Issues:

Missing React.memo for expensive components
Unnecessary re-renders in resume preview
No lazy loading for large components
üõ°Ô∏è Security Recommendations

Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
Add Rate Limiting
Secure Headers Implementation
Database Security Enhancements:
Strengthen RLS Policies
Add Audit Logging
