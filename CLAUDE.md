 # Using Gemini CLI for Large Codebase Analysis

  When analyzing large codebases or multiple files that might exceed context limits, use the Gemini CLI with its massive
  context window. Use `gemini -p` to leverage Google Gemini's large context capacity.

  ## File and Directory Inclusion Syntax

  Use the `@` syntax to include files and directories in your Gemini prompts. The paths should be relative to WHERE you run the
   gemini command:

  ### Examples:

  **Single file analysis:**
  ```bash
  gemini -p "@src/main.py Explain this file's purpose and structure"

  Multiple files:
  gemini -p "@package.json @src/index.js Analyze the dependencies used in the code"

  Entire directory:
  gemini -p "@src/ Summarize the architecture of this codebase"

  Multiple directories:
  gemini -p "@src/ @tests/ Analyze test coverage for the source code"

  Current directory and subdirectories:
  gemini -p "@./ Give me an overview of this entire project"
  
#
 Or use --all_files flag:
  gemini --all_files -p "Analyze the project structure and dependencies"

  Implementation Verification Examples

  Check if a feature is implemented:
  gemini -p "@src/ @lib/ Has dark mode been implemented in this codebase? Show me the relevant files and functions"

  Verify authentication implementation:
  gemini -p "@src/ @middleware/ Is JWT authentication implemented? List all auth-related endpoints and middleware"

  Check for specific patterns:
  gemini -p "@src/ Are there any React hooks that handle WebSocket connections? List them with file paths"

  Verify error handling:
  gemini -p "@src/ @api/ Is proper error handling implemented for all API endpoints? Show examples of try-catch blocks"

  Check for rate limiting:
  gemini -p "@backend/ @middleware/ Is rate limiting implemented for the API? Show the implementation details"

  Verify caching strategy:
  gemini -p "@src/ @lib/ @services/ Is Redis caching implemented? List all cache-related functions and their usage"

  Check for specific security measures:
  gemini -p "@src/ @api/ Are SQL injection protections implemented? Show how user inputs are sanitized"

  Verify test coverage for features:
  gemini -p "@src/payment/ @tests/ Is the payment processing module fully tested? List all test cases"

  When to Use Gemini CLI

  Use gemini -p when:
  - Analyzing entire codebases or large directories
  - Comparing multiple large files
  - Need to understand project-wide patterns or architecture
  - Current context window is insufficient for the task
  - Working with files totaling more than 100KB
  - Verifying if specific features, patterns, or security measures are implemented
  - Checking for the presence of certain coding patterns across the entire codebase

  Important Notes

  - Paths in @ syntax are relative to your current working directory when invoking gemini
  - The CLI will include file contents directly in the context
  - No need for --yolo flag for read-only analysis
  - Gemini's context window can handle entire codebases that would overflow Claude's context
  - When checking implementations, be specific about what you're looking for to get accurate results # Using Gemini CLI for Large Codebase Analysis

# Project Overview - Resume Enhancer

## Architecture Summary
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage) + Edge Functions (Deno)
- **AI/LLM**: Groq API (Llama 3.1), Google Cloud Document AI
- **Payments**: Stripe integration with subscription management
- **PDF Generation**: @react-pdf/renderer (client), LaTeX compilation (server)

## Key Components & Data Flow
1. **User uploads resume** → File stored in Supabase Storage
2. **process-resume Edge Function** → Document AI extracts text → Groq enhances content → Saves structured JSON
3. **ATS Analyzer** → Separate edge function analyzes resume with AI scoring
4. **Frontend Preview** → Renders PDF/LaTeX from JSON data
5. **Payment System** → Stripe manages subscriptions, webhooks update user limits

## Database Schema
- **profiles**: User data, subscription info, usage limits
- **resumes**: Resume metadata, processing status, ATS scores  
- **payments**: Transaction logs

## Critical Edge Functions
- `/process-resume`: Main AI enhancement pipeline
- `/ats-analyzer`: Standalone ATS scoring service
- `/test-groq-api`: API key validation

## Common Issues & Solutions
- **ATS Analyzer not working**: Check if requests reach edge function, verify Gemini API key
- **Static values returned**: Usually indicates API failure or timeout
- **Processing stuck**: Check Supabase Storage permissions and edge function logs

## Recent Fixes (Jul 2025)
- **Fixed Gemini API response handling**: Updated to use `generationConfig` with `responseSchema` for structured JSON output
- **Optimized ATS analysis**: Added caching to prevent duplicate API calls for same resume text
- **Improved error handling**: Robust fallback mechanisms for different Gemini API response formats
