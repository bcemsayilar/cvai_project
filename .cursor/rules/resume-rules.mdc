- Project Goal: Build a profitable AI resume enhancement SaaS that delivers professional-quality results
- Tech Stack: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, LLM API (currently groq) with Llama 3.1
- Data Flow: User uploads resume -> Extract text -> Process with Groq -> Structure as JSON -> Render in template
- Resume Enhancement Priority: Quantify achievements, use action verbs, improve formatting, tailor to industry
- Feature Delivery Priority: Core functionality > UI polish > Advanced features > Marketing elements
- Template Management: Maintain resume templates as separate, parameterized components
- Error Handling: Gracefully handle API failures, invalid inputs, and rendering issues
- Security: Treat all user resume data as sensitive, ensure proper access controls
- Performance: Optimize for quick enhancement turnaround (target <1 minute)
- Code Organization: Group by feature rather than technical function
