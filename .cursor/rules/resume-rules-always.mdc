Project Goal: Build a profitable AI resume enhancement SaaS that delivers professional-quality results
- MAIN FOCUS: Deliver a working resume enhancer that produces better results than the user's original - everything else is secondary
- Rule 1: Implement only what's needed for the current iteration; reject any feature idea that doesn't directly improve core resume enhancement quality
- Rule 2: Always prioritize shipping over perfection - one working feature is better than three half-implemented ones
- Rule 3: If a proposed code change doesn't directly contribute to generating better resumes or improving user conversion, it's not a priority.
